# BeatSaberSongUpgrader
Simple python file to upgrade beatsaber songs from the old to new format en masse

I threw this together to solve a problem apparently only I had, because I stopped playing BeatSaber when they killed the multiplayer mods, and my entire song library became obsolete.

I couldn't find anything online to easily upgrade them, and doing it one by one was out of the question, so here we are.

Set your baseDir on line 11 and run the script
It'll convert as many custom songs as it can and dump them in the CustomLevels folder

At which point you should be good to launch your game and they will show up

If you find this useful, cool
If you think the code is ugly, you should see the stuff I get paid to write :D
